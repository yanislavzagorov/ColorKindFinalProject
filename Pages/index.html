                Color Vision Deficiency comes in many forms and ranges of severity, but is in essence the same biological disorder. The human eye consists of an array of light-sensitive equipment. Your light-bending lens concentrates the light coming into your eyes through the light-sensing retina to your macula, a point where light is concentrated and later translated into an image in your brain. 
                
                The job of assigning color to these images is divided between three cone-like receptors; one for each red, blue, and green wavelength. When a person is color deficient, this basically means that at least of these cones is misaligned, and is not properly displaying the wavelengts that the pupil is taking in.
